## Hashgraph Contracts

These smart contracts provide developers and users alike with contracts that can be used for a number of different applications. Users of the contracts can make bets, hold money in escrow, or perform simple arithmetic.

The are written to be used on the Hedera Hashgraph platform and take advantages of the speed and efficiency provided by this network over competitors. More specifically, these contracts will be written with the following advantages in mind:

- Faster transactions
- Lower fees (due to a higher supply vs. demand)
- Different network and abilities

The contracts will serve as an onramp for people to use the Hedera Hashgraph platform in a smooth and seamless way.

## Usage

The contracts in this repository are meant to be deployed and used by people of all experience ranges. They are not modular, nor are they intended to be. Instead they are meant to work out-of-the-box for anyone who wants to deploy and use the contracts without much technical overhead. Certain design decisions were made to facilitate the aforementioned operations.

Any parties wanting to use the contracts would simply follow the flow provided in the documentation of each contract. More detailed information will be provided in directory-specific README files at a later time.

## Testing

To run all the tests, simply run `truffle test`
